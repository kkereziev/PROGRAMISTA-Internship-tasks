Task â„– 1: Brothers in the Bar

The solution for this task is located in BrothersInTheBar\BrothersInTheBar\Program.cs. The solution itself has two methods: CreateArray and 
FindRounds. The CreateArray method creates the array(was thinking of creating list instead but decided to proceed with array). I wasn't quite sure if I'm to create the array via for cycle with given length or to simply console read the array so I did it both ways with the second way currently in use and the first I've put in #region. Right now the CreateArray method is reading the array from the console, splitting the array by ", " and parsing each number to int via Select method.
The second method FindRounds is where we find the number of the rounds. Firstly we create list from the array so we can use the RemoveRange method from the list. This way when we find 3 consecutive glasses we can remove them from the list. I'm using for cycle to loop through the array. The condition list.Count-2 takes care of 2 problems: the first one is that the looping stops if the array has less than 3 elements and the second one is to protect the program from index out of range error because of the if statement. In the if statement we are simply checking if the current element is equal to the next 2 elements. If so we increment the rounds variable, remove the 3 equal elements and start looping from the start of the list.
